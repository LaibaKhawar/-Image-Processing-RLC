# -Image-Processing-RLC
 Utilized C++ to develop a  comprehensive image processing project. Calculated essential image statistics and implemented connected component  extraction for efficient segmentation. Employed run-length coding (RLC) using linked lists to reduce transmission  bandwidth requirements

Enter the number of times you must run the application, followed by the question options 1
 through 3. When you press 1, only Question 1 is executed. Option 2 and 3 requires knowing the
 coordinates of the pixels to read from the image before it can display the connected 8
 components with the same values and it then performs the necessary enqueuing, dequeuing or
 pushing, and popping(respectively). So enter the coordinates, and the programm will run in
 accordance with the requirements of the question
